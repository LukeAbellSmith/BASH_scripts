# BASH_scripts
Scripts. No specific category, just any standalone scripts

Read the comments in each script for details on functionality.

I do not guarantee they're polished or work flawlessly, but they seem to be at least adequately functional.


# License

These are just scripts, so licensing under anything else seems a bit silly.
If you copy/share these around, I would appreciate you linking back here, 
however it is not a requirement.
